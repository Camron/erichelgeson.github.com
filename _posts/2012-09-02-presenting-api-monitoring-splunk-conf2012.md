Dan Cundiff and I will be presenting at Splunk .conf 2012 about our API monitoring with Splunk. Will be going over our approach, what we're doing now and what we plan on in the future.

Come see us present September 12th @ 4:15 PM, and look for the session titled 'Splunk All the Things: Our First 3 Months Monitoring Web Service APIs'. If you have questions afterwards come talk to us and can always find us on twitter.

Also have an idea for the Splunk hackathon September 11th @ 5:30-10:30pm with node.js logging and Splunk, Stay tuned, if it works out I'll post it on github.
